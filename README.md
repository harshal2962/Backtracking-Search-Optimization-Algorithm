# Backtracking-Search-Optimization-Algorithm

The backtracking search optimization algorithm (BSA) is a population-based evolutionary algorithm for numerical optimization problems. BSA has a powerful global exploration capacity while its local exploitation capability is relatively poor. 

BSA has been mainly used in five primary cohorts, which are Artificial Intelligence, Robotics engineering, Electrical and Mechanical engineering, Information and communication engineering, and  Civil engineering.

BSA uses three basic genetic operators – selection, mutation and crossover – to generate trial individuals. BSA has a random mutation strategy that uses only one direction individual for each target individual, in contrast with many genetic algorithms such as DE and its derivatives. BSA uses three basic genetic operators– selection, mutation and crossover – to generate trial individuals. BSA has a random mutation strategy that uses only one direction individual for each target individual, in contrast with many genetic algorithms such as DE and its derivatives. It generates a heterogeneous and complicated crossover strategy. 
BSA’s algorithmic structure enables it to benefit from previous generation populations by using solutions it has found in the past for a given problem as it searches for solutions with better fitness values. BSA’s bio-inspired philosophy is analogous to the return of a social group of living creatures at random intervals to hunting areas that were previously found fruitful for obtaining nourishment.

I have used BSA to solve a long term demand forecasting problem for a power generation company owing to it's strong potential to solve numerical optimisation problems.
